Planning Meeting Minutes:
*****************************
Attendees : Mariot Tsitoara, Rufus C Sharma, Ganesh, Tilak

Project Agenda : If there is any noise detected, start the video recording and stream it live to the user.

Project Phases:
        Phase I :   Noise detection and Powering on the came
                        Hardware Required :
                            Option 1: Mic(Sound Sensor) - Wired, Raspberry PI, Cam - Wired
                                                                                                                
                            Option 2: Mic(Sound Sensor) - Wireless, Raspberry PI (With Wireless Modules), Cam - Wireless
                        Software Required : To be Decided
                                
        Phase II :  Alert Notification and Tranferring the Video to user
                        Hardware Required : Raspberry PI (with Ethernet Patch cable or someother Technology)
                        Software Required :   To be Decided
                        
PHASE I :   Noise detection and Powering on the CAM
*********

We can have either wired connection or wireless connection. both has it own advantage and disadvantage.

Wired:
******

    Advantages:

    1. No Sepearte power required

    2. Reliable in all environment

    3. easy to use and operate

    Disadvantages:

    1. Physical cabling should be done. it Limits the movement of device from place to place..

    2. it is fixed in one place

    3. Pi should be near

Wireless:
*********

    Advantages:

    1. Can be installed anywhere.

    2. No mess of cabling

    3. Can be moved anywhere.

    4. Pi need not to be nearer

    disadvantages:

    1. Sepearte power should be provided (battery)

    2. Wireless enabled devices are needed

    3. Cost is more compared to wired

Task for team for the next meeting:
    To decide on the technology, either Wired or Wireless.

Planning Meeting Minutes - Phase I:
*************************************
Attendees : Rufus C Sharma , Sandraghassen [Ganesh], Tilak Marupilla

Tasks to be done:
********************
 
Need to figure out whether the state things are available and possible
1) Is there any wireless Sound sensor/MIC for PI (even any other board can be considered)
2) Similarly any wireless Cam is available or not...
3) If none of this available.. then we have to see for the possibility whether we can come up with one

If none of this is possible then, The best option is wired sensor and wired cam directly connected/mounted to PI.. 
and then we can access it through VNC, SSH or someother means.. this is bit cheaper one..
