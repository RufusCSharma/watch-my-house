Planning Meeting Minutes:
*****************************
Attendees : Mariot Tsitoara, Rufus C Sharma, Ganesh, Tilak

Project Agenda : If there is any noise detected, start the video recording and stream it live to the user.

Project Phases:
        Phase I :   Noise detection and Powering on the came
                        Hardware Required :
                            Option 1: Mic(Sound Sensor) - Wired, Raspberry PI, Cam - Wired
                                                                                                                
                            Option 2: Mic(Sound Sensor) - Wireless, Raspberry PI (With Wireless Modules), Cam - Wireless
                        Software Required : To be Decided
                                
        Phase II :  Alert Notification and Tranferring the Video to user
                        Hardware Required : Raspberry PI (with Ethernet Patch cable or someother Technology)
                        Software Required :   To be Decided
                        
PHASE I :   Noise detection and Powering on the CAM

We can have either wired connection or wireless connection. both has it own advantage and disadvantage.

Wired:
******

    Advantages:

    1. No Sepearte power required

    2. Reliable in all environment

    3. easy to use and operate

    Disadvantages:

    1. Physical cabling should be done. it Limits the movement of device from place to place..

    2. it is fixed in one place

    3. Pi should be near

Wireless:
*********

    Advantages:

    1. Can be installed anywhere.

    2. No mess of cabling

    3. Can be moved anywhere.

    4. Pi need not to be nearer

    disadvantages:

    1. Sepearte power should be provided (battery)

    2. Wireless enabled devices are needed

    3. Cost is more compared to wired

Task for team for the next meeting:
    To decide on the technology, either Wired or Wireless.
